## Procedural Fireball

Starting with an icosphere, I used a compination of sinusoid functions, noise functions, and standard toolbox functions to create a fireball from procedural deformation and coloring.

# Custom OBJ Import

You can use the file browser to import a custom obj file that will have the fireball shaders applied to it. If the button to do so does not show up on the screen, you may need to tab through the page until focus reaches it.
