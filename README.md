## Summary
- I implemented Fractual Brownian Motion noise on the fireball model so that the entire fireball looks have multiple layers on itself.
- I created a huge sphere in the scene as a game skybox and implemented a fancy shader with a gradient color change and a pulsing effect as a background.
- The user can change the speed to adjust the pulsing frequency.
- The user can modify the color of the fireball.
- The user can increase the size of the fireball.
