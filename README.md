# [Project 1: Noise](https://github.com/CIS-566-Fall-2022/hw01-fireball-base)

## Objective

Get comfortable with using WebGL and its shaders to generate an interesting 3D, continuous surface using a multi-octave noise algorithm.
Use Toolbox functions to create flowers!

## Features

-  Gradient backgrounds that fluctuate over time
        
-  Timed fireball surface animation with four Toolbox functions
        
 - 3D Perlin Noise and FBM for time-varying, low and high-frequency vertex normal offset effects.
        
-  Linear interpolation to form a color gradient on the surface of the fireball based on the coloring of the vertex offsets
        
-  High-degree-of-freedom interaction to control the initial color, amplitude, frequency, and time factor of three different parts of the fireball.
        
-  See the code implementation for more details.
