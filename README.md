## Fireball

This is my fireball:  
![fireball](image.png)  

I pulled out a bunch of points on top using similarities to a dot product for randomized directions.
I used fbm to create smaller noise. It also influences the color
The color is also influenced by how far away a point is in both object space and screen space from the center of the fireball.  

The background is made using two gradients mixed by fbm noise.
